# Impulse: Do Something

This web app helps people discover places near them to do activities, and then provides directions to get there.
The search can be either the user's current location or a custom location, and the directions are based on that location.
It uses the Foursquare API (explore endpoint) to provide venues, and the Google Maps Directions API for routing.

Results are displayed in a grid. The names can be clicked to open the listed website in a new tab or window. The address
can be clicked to show directions below the results.

## Other technologies used

* Bootstrap 3.3.7 for styling
